## Exact Solution Required

### Immediate Action (5-10 minutes):

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select Hong Kong Church PWA project

2. **Execute Database Schema**
   - Open SQL Editor
   - Copy entire contents of `/database/quick_deploy.sql`
   - Paste and execute
   - Wait for completion message

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Execute `/database/verify_production_setup.sql`
   - Confirm all tables and data are created

### Expected Result After Database Deployment:

```
✅ API Endpoint: /api/devotions → Returns devotional content
✅ API Endpoint: /api/prayers → Returns prayer requests  
✅ API Endpoint: /api/events → Returns church events
✅ Interactive Features: All buttons and forms work
✅ Authentication: User login/signup functional
✅ Dynamic Content: Real data instead of static content
```

## Current Application State

### ✅ Fully Functional (No Database Required):
- Homepage with professional design
- Navigation and layout
- PWA installation and offline features
- Mobile responsiveness
- Language switching
- Static content display

### ⏳ Pending Database (Will Work After SQL Deployment):
- User registration and login
- Daily devotion reading progress
- Prayer request submission and interaction
- Event registration and management  
- Bible bookmark saving
- User profile management
- Real-time community features
