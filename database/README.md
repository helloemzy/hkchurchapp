# Hong Kong Church PWA - Production Database Deployment Guide

## üèõÔ∏è Database Architecture Overview

This production database deployment provides a complete, scalable foundation for the Hong Kong Church Progressive Web Application. The system is designed specifically for Hong Kong church communities with full Traditional Chinese support and local cultural considerations.

### üìä Database Statistics
- **28 Core Tables** with comprehensive relationships
- **115 Performance Indexes** for sub-second query response
- **78 Row Level Security Policies** for data protection
- **20 Database Functions** for business logic
- **18 Triggers** for automated data management
- **30 Days** of sample devotional content
- **Hong Kong Localization** with timezone and holiday support

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- Supabase Production Project created
- Database access credentials available
- Backup strategy configured
- Monitoring tools ready

### Step 1: Core Schema Deployment (20 minutes)
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
\i database/001_initial_schema.sql
```

**What This Creates:**
- 15 Core tables (profiles, devotions, events, groups, prayers)
- 8 Security tables (audit logs, security events, consent tracking)
- 5 Analytics tables (reading streaks, achievements, performance logs)
- 20 Database triggers for automated updates
- Custom data types and constraints

**Validation:**
```sql
-- Verify table creation
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
-- Expected: 28 tables
```

### Step 2: Performance Optimization (15 minutes)
```sql
-- Execute performance indexes
\i database/002_indexes_and_performance.sql
```

**What This Creates:**
- 115 Optimized indexes for all query patterns
- 3 Materialized views for analytics
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Full-text search indexes for content discovery
- Performance monitoring functions

**Validation:**
```sql
-- Verify index creation
SELECT COUNT(*) as index_count 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';
-- Expected: 115+ indexes
```

### Step 3: Security Implementation (10 minutes)
```sql
-- Execute security policies
\i database/003_security_and_rls.sql
```

**What This Creates:**
- 78 Row Level Security policies
- Role-based access control functions
- Audit logging triggers
- Security monitoring views
- Data privacy compliance tools

**Validation:**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT COUNT(*) as policy_count 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
-- Expected: 78+ policies
```

### Step 4: Production Data Seeding (15 minutes)
```sql
-- Execute seed data
\i database/004_seed_data.sql
```

**What This Creates:**
- 30 days of devotional content
- Hong Kong church calendar with holidays
- Sample events and small groups
- Achievement system setup
- Church configuration settings
- Analytics tracking setup

**Validation:**
```sql
-- Verify seeded content
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM devotions) as devotions,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events) as events,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM small_groups) as groups,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM achievements) as achievements;
-- Expected: 30+ devotions, 3+ events, 3+ groups, 6+ achievements
```

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Every table has comprehensive RLS policies ensuring:
- Users can only access their own data
- Group leaders can manage their group members
- Pastors have appropriate pastoral access
- Admins have full system access
- Public content is properly filtered

### Audit Trail
Complete audit logging captures:
- All data modifications with before/after states
- Security events and login attempts
- User consent and privacy compliance
- Performance metrics and system health

### Data Privacy Compliance
- GDPR-compliant consent tracking
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data export and portability features
- Automatic data anonymization options

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Query Performance
- **Sub-second response** for all common queries
- **Composite indexes** for complex filtering
- **Materialized views** for analytics dashboards
- **Connection pooling** configuration included

### Scalability Features
- **Partitioning ready** for large datasets
- **Read replicas** configuration support
- **Automatic vacuum** optimization
- **Connection limits** and pooling

## üåè Hong Kong Localization

### Language Support
- **Traditional Chinese (zh-HK)** as primary
- **Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)** support
- **English** for international members
- **Multilingual content** in all tables

### Cultural Features
- **Hong Kong timezone** (Asia/Hong_Kong)
- **HKD currency** formatting
- **Local phone number** validation
- **Public holidays** calendar
- **Chinese calendar** integration

### Church Calendar
- Hong Kong public holidays 2024-2025
- Christian liturgical calendar
- Local church events and seasons
- Cantonese cultural considerations

## üö® Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks
```sql
-- Database health check query
SELECT 
    'database_health' as metric,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 'healthy'
        ELSE 'error'
    END as status,
    COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Query execution time tracking
- Connection pool utilization
- Index usage statistics
- Cache hit ratios

### Security Monitoring
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Data access pattern analysis
- Policy violation alerts

## üîß Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Tasks
```sql
-- Refresh analytics views
SELECT refresh_analytics_views();

-- Check system health
SELECT * FROM security_dashboard;
```

### Weekly Tasks
```sql
-- Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Check index usage
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan < 100;
```

### Monthly Tasks
```sql
-- Review security events
SELECT * FROM security_events WHERE investigated = false;

-- Performance review
SELECT * FROM query_performance_log 
WHERE execution_time_ms > 1000 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups
- **Daily full backups** at 2 AM HKT
- **Point-in-time recovery** enabled
- **Cross-region replication** recommended
- **Backup verification** automated

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Point-in-time recovery** for data corruption
2. **Table-level restore** for specific issues
3. **Full system restore** for disasters
4. **Data export tools** for migrations

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Query Performance
```sql
-- Identify slow queries
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_exec_time > 1000 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;
```

#### Connection Issues
```sql
-- Check connection limits
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

#### RLS Policy Problems
```sql
-- Test user permissions
SELECT has_role_or_higher('member', '[user-id]');
```
